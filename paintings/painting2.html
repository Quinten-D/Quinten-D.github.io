            <h2>GenAI experiment</h2>
            <p>An experiment with multimodel generative AI assistance. Left is a hand drawn "pixel art" image, which was given to a multimodel AI model along with the prompt "a baroque still life". The AI model generated an image 
                (right) based on its input which has the necessary details to satisfy the prompt. This proved succesfull overall, as the model preserved the "spirit" of the initial sketch in its composition and use of 
                color while simultaneously adding the requested amount of detail. </p>
