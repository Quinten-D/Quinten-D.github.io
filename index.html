            <p>I'm a computer science student who is passionate about artificial intelligence and art. This page serves as a shared portfolio for my works as an amateur painter and AI enthusiast. I'm invested in both subjects as (seemingly) independent domains, withouth limiting myself to the overlap that exists between them (e.g. GenAI).
                Even though my pursuits are quite different in nature, I'm very happy to present them on a unified platform as this onorthodox combination comes very natural to me.

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Although initially attracted to AI by the breakthrough achievements of deep learning, my area of interest has considerably widened since then. I have a profound interest in theoretical computer science, machine learning topics such as reinforcement learning and meta-learning, and neurosymbolic AI. I have not settled on any topic in particular and continue
                to explore the various subdomains of artificial intelligence. Most of my practical AI projects so far have had a focus on optical character recognition, potentially using background knowledge. However, I've worked with other application domains as well, e.g. automatic video game-level generation & image segmentation.

            <h2>Paintings</h2>
            <p>As an amateur painter I enjoy transferring some of my thoughts to (digital) canvas. The majority of these paintings are digital, but I have experience with oil paints, silk screen printing, spray paints, and other physical media as well. My works mainly consist of hand-drawn 2D images with some room for experimentation with 3D software and generative AI assistance.</p>
